# ❄️ WarmGive

**WarmGive** is a compassionate platform that connects donors with volunteers to distribute winter clothing to those in need across Bangladesh. This single-page application encourages giving by simplifying the donation process, particularly for low-income and rural areas during the cold season.

## 📝 Project Overview

WarmGive enables users to explore current winter clothing donation campaigns, learn about the need for warm clothing, and participate by donating items. Through private routes and secure authentication, users can log in, view donation campaigns, and access their personalized dashboard to manage their profile.

## 🌟 Key Features

   Users must log in to donate. Without logging in, they are redirected to the login page, ensuring secure access to donation features and personal data.

2. **Donation Campaigns**  
   Visitors can view all active campaigns under the "Donation Campaigns" section, learning about different initiatives before logging in to contribute.

3. **User Dashboard and Profile Management**

4. **Forgot Password Feature**
